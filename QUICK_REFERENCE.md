## 🎯 Critical Success Factors

### 1. **Nail the Core Experience First**
❌ Don't: Build everything at once
✅ Do: Perfect Telegram bot experience
- Fast responses (<3 seconds)
- Accurate data
- Actionable insights
- Great UX

### 2. **Start with FREE Value**
Free tier must be genuinely useful:
- 3 queries/day is enough to test
- Show real institutional-grade analysis
- Hook users with quality
- Upsell based on need

### 3. **Focus on Chiller Costs**
This is your MOAT - no one else does this:
- Average savings: AED 50K-150K per property
- Use this as marketing hook
- "We saved investors AED 5M in hidden costs"

### 4. **Leverage Social Proof**
- Reddit snagging reports are GOLD
- No other platform aggregates this
- "See what real owners say before you buy"

### 5. **Build for Agents, Not Just Buyers**
Agents bring volume:
- 1 agent = 10-50 clients
- Agency = 100+ clients
- Commission model = recurring revenue

## 🚨 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### ❌ Don't Do:
1. Wait for all APIs before launching
2. Build website before proving Telegram works
3. Spend on ads before product-market fit
4. Raise prices too early
5. Ignore churn metrics

### ✅ Do:
1. Launch with free APIs first
2. Get 100 users on Telegram, THEN build website
3. Organic growth first, ads after PMF
4. Keep Free tier valuable, upsell on features
5. Talk to churned users
